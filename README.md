# Basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model using Calculus

This project implements a basic feedforward neural network using numpy for matrix operations. The network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with a sigmoid activation function, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function. The weights and biases are initialized randomly.
Using gradient descent method model learns to predict values.
